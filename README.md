# [Gather Your Party v2](http://gatheryourparty.com)

Gather Your Party is an independent, non-profit organization devoted to honest video game journalism, critique, and analysis.

GYP is all about community spirit, and it is in that spirit that I've decided to totally open-source the site, so that people can pick apart how everything works, help us improve, and use our code to build awesome things.

## Features

* Stylish new design that isn't a ripoff of anything in particular
* Powerful, beautiful custom article authoring tools and layouts
* A comments system that doesn't suck
* A tablet\mobile view that almost doesn't suck
* Support for semi-anonymous submissions
* Author bios
* Spahgetti code

## License

This content is almost all licensed under a a proprietary open-source license called KYGMOYGPL. Please read it (license.md) if you intend to use or contribute to the source code in any way. In principle, it works similarly to the creative commons attribution noncommercial license, but a little more specific. This site also uses code from various frameworks, content management systems and independent authors, which is NOT covered by the KYGMOYGPL, and is noted when used (I hope!).

## Quick start

GYP2 is available as a WordPress theme that you can just dump into your wp-content/themes folder. However, a large chunk of the functionality is also provided by third-party plugins, which you'll need to install.

The essential ones are:

* Advanced custom fields by Elliot Condon (awesome plugin!)
* Contextual related posts by Ajay D'Souza
* WP Smart Pagination by Kharis Sulistiyono
* MediaElement.js by John Dyer
* TinyMCE Advanced by Andrew Ozz
* User Submitted Posts by Jeff Starr

For an optimal GYP experience, you should also consider installing

* 404 Redirected by Weberz Hosting
* Relevanssi by Mikko Saari
* Some sort of caching plugin

GYP2 uses a specific configuration of ACF, but you can refer to the source code to see which fields are being referenced and what they do.

## Contributing

We absolutely welcome contributions and improvements from anyone and everyone.

## Wishlist

* Slideshows in posts
* Multiple image caption styles instead of just one (the CSS for this exists but tinyMCE removes the HTML tags from the visual editor)
* Overview of series (e.g. podcast series: gypodcast, gyperspective, gentlemen discussing vidya) on tag pages
* Featured articles on the front page (the CSS for this is present)
* >920px view that still looks good
* 'Popular articles' as well as 'similar articles'
* Refactoring of genuinely awful spaghetti code
* Let users pick RPG-style stats for their 'about' page bio
